      <h1>What is Local Bread?</h1>
      <p>
        Local Bread is an app where food retail stores and restaurants can make postings about surplus food that would
        potentially become waste. People using the app can see these postings which include detailed information like
        the type of food, allergy information, and expiration date, as well as the location of where the food is being
        delivered.
      </p>
      <p>
        This app is designed for providing an additional avenue for people and their families to meet their nutritional
        needs,
        who otherwise would struggle to make ends meet. It addresses the ongoing issue of immense food waste in the US.
        The US
        EPA reported in 2020 that food retail and hospitality sectors generated approximately 12.6 million tons of food
        waste, of
        which only 24% was donated to food banks or other people, while 31% was landfilled.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope that Local Bread can be utilized by communities across the nation to serve those people most in need.
        Whatever
        sector of society you hail from, we hope that you can use Local Bread for your own help or to help those you
        know and
        those around you!
