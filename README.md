# Local Bread

## Description

Local Bread is an app where food retail stores and restaurants can make postings about surplus food, empowering the food insecure to secure local food through mobile technology.

## How to use

Simply clone this directory by using ```git clone https://github.com/bananna16/localbread.git```
You can run our project in a web application by running the index.html file. As this app is meant to be used with a community rather than individually, the app should be used over the link [localbread.web.app](https://localbread.web.app). A video detailing how to use the app is available at [our devpost](https://devpost.com/software/local-bread). 

## Technology Stack
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for the front-end development. We also used google maps through the JavaScript API to include the interactive map of the available locations for food. The website is deployed on Firebase, but we were unable to get their authentication and database functionalities to work.

## Examples of Use
Restaurants or other food retailers will first sign-up for an account in order to post food drop-off locations. All others who wish to view the food drop-off locations don't need to sign in, and can go to the map from the first page to view the locations available. To learn more about a location, the user can click on the marker on the map to get information about pick-up time, address, food types, and the description.

## Project Status
The app's front-end is complete. The back-end, however, is not fully integrated with firebase. This is something we can continue developing in the future. Our future steps with this project include getting the authentication / log-in process to work with firebase and to set up the Cloud Firestore to work with storing the locations of food pick-up locations.
