# Local Bread

## Description

Local Bread is an app where food retail stores and restaurants can make postings about surplus food, empowering the food insecure to secure local food through mobile technology.

## How to use

Simply clone this directory by using ```git clone https://github.com/bananna16 ```
You can run our project in a web application by running the index.htlm file. As this app is meant to be used with a community rather than individually, the app should be used over the link [localbread.web.app](https://localbread.web.app).

## Technology Stack
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for the front-end development. We also used google maps through the JavaScript API to include the map of the available locations for food. We also have some firebase code, but was unable to get it up and running.

## Examples of Use
Restaurants or other food retailers will first sign-up for an account in order to post food drop-off locations. All others who wish to view the food drop-off locations don't need to sign in, and can go to the map from the first page to view the locations available. To learn more about a location, the user can click on the marker on the map to get information about pick-up time, address, food types, and the description.

## Project Status
The app's front-end is complete. The back-end, however, is not fully integrated with firebase. This is something we can continue developing in the future.
